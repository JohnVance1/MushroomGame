  - 'Stranger: Hmmmm.......'
  - Um, excuse me, I'm looking for Lamella Village. The sign over there said that
    it was up ahead but but I can't find it.
  - 'Hello? '
  - 'Stranger: Oh! Yes, you''ll be perfect. Do you know how to fight? '
  - 'Fight? No I''m looking for the closest village so I can use its Myceleporter,
    to get back to school.

'
  - 'Stranger: Nonsense, you were sent here by the Gods to help us reclaim the village.
    The people of Lamella have been driven away by a terrible beast.  '
  - I'm sorry to hear that but I need to get back-
  - 'Stranger: If you want to leave you''re going to have to fight me. '
